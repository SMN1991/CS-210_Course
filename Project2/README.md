Project 2 ReadMe 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was to create a piece of software that would display the power of investing and compound interest in particular.

What did you do particularly well?
  Showing the power of classes was a focus of this project, and I think I did that well. In addition, I believe I did a good job following best practices and standards as well.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I'mn fairly happy with the code doing exactly what it was intended to do. My only change would be to expand the functionality of the project. Possibly show more complicated investing simulations or different kinds of investing.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I'm getting more familiar with knowing how to research issues I am having, and translating example of different code usage into what I need it to do. My code reading skills have improved dramatically and I'm feeling more confident in my ability to learn more complicated coding.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  This project was a great stepping stone into the world of OOP, in particular classes. I feel more confident in my writing code which uses multiple classes. I also feel more confident in my ability to properly plan software, a skill I was a little worried about learning. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   The use of clear function and variable names was something, in addition to clear defined classes and the use of encapsulation.
